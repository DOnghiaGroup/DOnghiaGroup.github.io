            <h2>Galactic Dynamics</h2>
            <p>
              The Radcliffe wave is a recently discovered, spatially and kinematically coherent structure, which is 2.7 kpc long and is formed by the young star forming regions in the solar neighborhood. The molecular clouds in this region, align themselves to form a damped sinusoidal wave-like structure with a maximum vertical displacement of around 160 pc. However, the nature and origin of this feature found in the dense gas is not well understood. Taking advantage of the proper motion of young stars in the solar neighborhood from Gaia, I am currently working on identifying the Radcliffe wave signature in young stars and to understand the nature of this undulation by studying the distribution of median vertical velocity. We further extend our study to explore similar signatures of oscillation in the young stars beyond the region of the Radcliffe wave. Using a combination of the chemical abundances and radial velocities of these stars provided by the Milky Way mapper in the SDSS-V, we aim at constraining the nature of this oscillation.

            <h2>Magellanic System</h2>
            <p>
              The Magellanic Stream is one of the most complex gaseous structures in the Milky Way’s immediate environment. The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC/SMC), through their mutual interactions over the past several billion years, have lost over a billion solar masses through tidal and ram pressure forces, and the Milky Way has stretched this gas into the Magellanic Stream we see today. It is a massive, multi-phase, filamentary, turbulent structure that we are only now beginning to fully understand. Recent work using absorption line spectroscopy along quasar sightlines has revealed a huge amount of ionized gas that cocoons the directly observable neutral hydrogen first mapped in 1974. This ionized component of the Stream contributes ~90% of the total mass, and until now there hasn’t been an explanation for the source of this majority of the Stream in tidal models. <a href="team#scott">Scott</a> has run novel N-body hydrodynamical simulations of the tidal and ram pressure interactions between the LMC, SMC, and Milky Way that lead to the formation of the Magellanic Stream and Leading Arm. We have included, for the first time, a Magellanic Corona of warm, ionized gas surrounding the Magellanic Clouds throughout their interactions that can account for the currently observed mass and multi-phase nature of the Stream. This Magellanic Corona is well motivated by the discovery of dwarf galaxies associated with the Magellanic Group, the high mass of the LMC (~2&times;10<sup>11</sup> solar masses), and the warm circumgalactic gas found around LMC-like galaxies in cosmological simulations. We predict that this Magellanic Corona will be unambiguously observable via high-ionization absorption lines in the ultraviolet spectra of background quasars lying near the LMC. This prediction is directly testable with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope.

            <h2>Gaia &amp; SDSS-V</h2>
            <p>The <i>Gaia</i> satellite is a telescope designed to observe the positions and velocities of billions of stars in our Milky Way Galaxy. It measures both the equatorial positions on the sky (right ascension and declination) as well as the parallax to determine a distance. Additionally, we get the proper motions and the radial velocities for many of the stars. We use <i>Gaia</i> data in many of our projects including analysis of the Radcliffe Wave and other <a href="#galactic-dynamics">Galactic Dynamics</a> projects, as well as exploring the structure of the <a href="#solar-neighborhood">Solar Neighborhood</a>.</p>

            <h2>Solar Neighborhood</h2>
            <p>
              The region of the Milky Way disk within a few hundred parsecs of the Sun has rich substructure. Due to the recent observations of the <a href="#gaia">Gaia</a> satellite, we are able to see subtle overdensities and underdensities in the kinematics of the solar neighborhood. Specifically, groups of stars with coherent motion, dubbed "moving groups", can be detected by locating these overdensities in the kinematic plane (radial vs azimuthal velocity space). By using wavelet transformation techniques these rich structures and subtle overdensities can be quantitatively located. <a href="team#scott">Scott</a> and <a href="team#emil">Emil</a> have developed this open source wavelet transformation code in Python, <a href="resources">MGwave</a> and have not only detected new moving groups, but have also been able to track these groups through the Milky Way's disk. By following these groups through galactocentric radius, we can learn a lot about the non-axisymmetric features of the Milky Way such as the bar and spiral arms. As we get more data extending out further from the Sun, these measurements will be crucial to determining the structure of our own Galaxy.
